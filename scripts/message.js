var textCareer = "<h1>Dev/QA Background</h1><p>Looking to transition from QA to Development, I attended Bellevue College and Seattle Coding Dojo during 2015 - 2016.</p><p>Prior to that, I spent several years as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer and was involved in various aspects of software development.</p><p>My 'normal' day might include such things as reviewing requirements, generating new test cases, running manual tests, debugging the latest batch of failed tests, writing and validating bug reports, creating and maintaining in-house QA testing tools for test-data generation and test-bed deployment, designing, running, and analyzing load and stress tests, and of course, participating in sprint planning and daily standups.</p>";
var textPersonal = "<h1>Who Am I <em>Really</em>?</h1><p>Married with children (three), I exist to serve my two cats (at least that's what they think), spend time with my wife, and go on walks with Moka, my Black and Tan Coonhound.</p><p>When not coding, playing guitar, eating, or sleeping, I can probably be found in front of my PS4, somewhere in the wilds of the Capital Wasteland, the outer rim of the galaxy, or making my way across Tamriel.</p><p>Random Things: 1) There's no beer I won't try at least once (Deschutes IPA or Black Butte Porter is the best beer EVUH -- and I don't get paid to say that!) 2) I prefer clean, minimalistic uncluttered spaces, designs, and workflows 3) The reason one hikes is because the path is there... the journey is it's own reward!</p>";
